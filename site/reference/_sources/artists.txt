Gameduino for Artists
---------------------

Like every other 8-bit game system, Gameduino has some restrictions
on the graphics it can display.  This page summarizes them
for graphic artists and animators.

Screen and colors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Gameduino's screen resolution is 400x300 pixels.  Pixels are square.
The screen refreshes at 72Hz, so natural rates for smooth animation
are 72, 36, 24, 18 or 12 fps.  Colors are 5 bits per channel, so
these are the hex RGB values of the available colors::

  00 *
  08
  10
  18
  20 *
  28
  30
  38
  40 *
  48
  50
  58
  60 *
  68
  70
  78
  80 *
  88
  90
  98
  a0 *
  a8
  b0
  b8
  c0 *
  c8
  d0
  d8
  e0 *
  e8
  f0
  f8

The display output is only 3-bit (the hardware uses a 2x2 dither for the intermediate colors), so
only the values marked with an asterisk are pure, undithered colors.  Check out the color ramps
and photograph in this image for an idea of what the dithering looks like:

Background graphics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Background graphics are character based.  The hardware supports 256
characters on screen at any time.  Each character is 8x8 pixels,
and each character can use up to four different colors.  To be clear: there are 256 characters available, and each has its own 
4-entry palette.
The screen resolution is 400x300 pixels,
or 50x37.5 characters.

  Asteroid image is 128x128 pixels and uses 256 characters, of which 198 are unique.
  This leaves 58 characters for other background elements.

This is the entire background set for the :ref:`scroll` demo.  The scroll program
creates each of the background elements by
copying rectangular pieces of this source image to the screen.

Foreground graphics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The foreground (sprite) system has a few modes.  Individual sprites are
16x16 pixels.  Larger sprites are made by combining these 16x16 sprites.

Sprite images are paletted: there are three palette modes: 256
color, 16 color and 4 color.  Transparent pixels count as one color
in the palette, so a sprite with transparency can use 255, 15 or 3
non-transparent colors.

The storage required for sprite images depends on the number of colors used.  The hardware
has room for 64 256-color sprites, 128 16-color sprites, or 256-4 color sprites, or any combination
of these.

The palettes available depend on the color mode.  There are four
256-color palettes, and two each of the 16 and 4 color palettes.
A paricular on-screen sprite can use any image, and any palette.

To save on sprite images, the hardware supports an 8-way flip/rotate
of the sprite image (see :ref:`rotate` for an example).
