Gameduino: a game adapter for the Arduino
=========================================

Tiny microcontrollers like the Atmel AVR used in the Arduino are
now much more powerful than the 8-bit computers from the 1980s.  So
why not use them to play video games?

Gameduino is a game adapter for Arduino - or anything else with an SPI
interface - built as a single shield that stacks up on top of the
Arduino and has plugs for a VGA monitor and stereo speakers.

The sound and graphics are definitely old-school, but
thanks to the latest FPGA technology,
the sprite capabilities are a step above those of
`past machines <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(computer_graphics)#Hardware_sprites>`_.

* video output is 400x300 pixels in 512 colors

 * all color processed internally at 15-bit precision
 * compatible with any standard VGA monitor (800x600 @ 72Hz)
 * background graphics

   * 512x512 pixel character background
   * 256 characters, each with independent 4 color palette
   * pixel-smooth X-Y wraparound scroll

 * foreground graphics

   * each sprite is 16x16 pixels with per-pixel transparency
   * each sprite can use 256, 16 or 4 colors
   * four-way rotate and flip
   * 96 sprites per scan-line, 1536 texels per line
   * pixel-perfect sprite collision detection

* audio output is a stereo 12-bit frequency synthesizer

 * 64 independent voices 10-8000 Hz
 * per-voice sine wave or white noise
 * sample playback channel

The Gameduino is controlled via SPI read/write operations, and looks
to the CPU like a 32Kbyte RAM.
(Unlike many 8-bit machines, there are no restrictions on when you can access this RAM).
There is a handy :download:`reference poster <poster.pdf>` showing
how the whole system works, and a set of
:ref:`sample programs <samples>` and
the :ref:`GD library <gd>`.
