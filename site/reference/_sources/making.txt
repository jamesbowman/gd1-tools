Making a Gameduino
------------------

The Gameduino board is a Xilinx FPGA - a fancy parallel processing chip - and a few support parts.  
If you're familiar with Xilinx FPGAs, JTAG and soldering fine-pitch surface-mount components, you
should be able to make a Gameduino board.  Otherwise, getting started with FPGAs can be a bit
of a steep learning curve.  See this page (:ref:`devboards`) for some good ways to get started.

All the design files for Gameduino are open-source.

The Eagle board layout is under http://excamera.com/files/gameduino/eagle/

The Verilog source for ISE Webpack 11.1 is under http://excamera.com/files/gameduino/verilog/

This should be enough to get the Gameduino up and running.  To load the SPI flash with the Gameduino
image, see `Xilinx application note XAPP974 <http://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/application_notes/xapp974.pdf>`_.

If there's interest in the bare PCB, let me know (jamesb@excamera.com) and I'll put it up on batchpcb.com.
