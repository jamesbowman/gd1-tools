The Gameduino hardware has a built-in random number generator.
The hardware uses it internally for the white noise sound effect, and your code can
access it using the coprocessor's ``RANDOM`` register.

Here it is being used to fill the screen with random noise - in the style of 
an off-station analog television.

  :language: c++

After the microprogram is loaded, there is nothing else that the Arduino program needs to do; the Gameduino
continuously updates the background character display.
