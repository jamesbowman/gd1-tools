Sample sketches
---------------

Each sample sketch is listed in this section, along with its source code.
All the code and data for these samples can be
`downloaded as a zip file </files/gameduino/synth/sketches/Gameduino.zip>`_.

To install this library:

 * download the ZIP file and unzip it, producing a ``Gameduino`` folder
 * open your Arduino sketchbook folder. If there is already a folder there called libraries, place the library folder in there. If not, create a folder called libraries in the sketchbook folder, and drop the library folder in there
 * restart the Arduino programming environment, and you should see your new library in the ``Sketch > Import Library`` menu.

The example sketches are under:
``File > Examples > Gameduino``.

``selftest`` is a good place to start: it runs a series of hardware tests.

To use :ref:`gd` in a sketch, go to the ``Sketch > Import Library`` menu and
select ``Gameduino``.
