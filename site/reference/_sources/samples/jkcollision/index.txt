This demonstration shows use of the hardware's JK collision detection mode.  In this mode,
each sprite belongs to either the J or K group, and collisions are only detected between different groups.

Here the J sprites are drawn in pink, and K sprites are in green.

Each colliding sprite is drawn in a darker color.  As the demonstration
runs, green (K) sprites cover each other but do not count as a
collision.  However when a green (K) sprite covers a pink (J) sprite,
the hardware sets the sprite's collision flag.

You can see the effect of switching off JK mode by changing this line in ``setup()``::

  GD.wr(JK_MODE, 0);

With this change, all sprite collisions - including green-green -
will trigger the collision flag.
